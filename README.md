# Global-BikeShare

## This is a web-app that is mobile-first which utilizes the citibike API coupled with Thunderforest's "opencyclemap" to alert a user to:
- Are there any bike share programs in this city? 
- Where are the bikes, and where am I in relation to the bikes?
- What website do I go to to find more information on how to use th bike share?

As far as I can find, there are no map based apps that solve this problem.
